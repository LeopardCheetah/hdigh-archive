how-did-i-get-here (abbreviated hdigh) was a blog (hosted by wordpress) that was run by someone who was good at math. It used to be found [here](https://how-did-i-get-here.com/), but the site has since been reclaimed by WordPress and is now derelict.


If you are new to hdigh's site, go take a look at about-me or olympiad or olympiad-resources.
